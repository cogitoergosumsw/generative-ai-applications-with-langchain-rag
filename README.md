# Generative AI Applications with LangChain and RAG

A comprehensive tutorial project demonstrating how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using LangChain and IBM Watsonx.ai. This project includes both educational Jupyter notebooks and functional Python applications.

## üìö Project Overview

This repository contains a complete learning path for building RAG applications, from basic document processing to full-stack chatbot implementations. The project is designed to teach the fundamentals of RAG systems through hands-on examples and practical applications.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### üìñ Educational Notebooks

The project includes several Jupyter notebooks that cover different aspects of RAG development:

- **`LangChain document loader.ipynb`** - Learn how to load documents from various sources (PDF, TXT, JSON, CSV, Word, HTML, etc.)
- **`LangChain text-splitter.ipynb`** - Master text splitting techniques for optimal document chunking
- **`LangChain vector store.ipynb`** - Create and manage vector databases (Chroma, FAISS) for document embeddings
- **`LangChain retriever.ipynb`** - Develop retrievers to fetch relevant document segments based on queries
- **`Embed documents with watsonx s embedding.ipynb`** - Use IBM Watsonx.ai embeddings for document processing
- **`Full document retrieve limitation.ipynb`** - Understand the limitations and challenges of document retrieval

### üöÄ Functional Applications

Two ready-to-use Python applications demonstrate practical RAG implementations:

#### 1. **`qabot.py`** - RAG-based Question Answering System
A complete RAG application that:
- Loads PDF documents using PyPDFLoader
- Splits documents into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- Creates embeddings using IBM Watsonx.ai (slate-30m-english-rtrvr model)
- Stores embeddings in a Chroma vector database
- Provides a Gradio web interface for document Q&A
- Uses IBM Granite-3-3-8b-instruct model for text generation

#### 2. **`llm_chat.py`** - Simple Chatbot Interface
A basic chatbot that:
- Uses IBM Watsonx.ai models (Mistral Medium or Granite)
- Provides a Gradio web interface for text-based conversations
- Demonstrates direct LLM interaction without RAG

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **LangChain** - Framework for building LLM applications
- **IBM Watsonx.ai** - AI platform for foundation models and embeddings
- **Gradio** - Web interface framework for ML applications
- **Chroma** - Vector database for storing embeddings
- **PyPDF2** - PDF document processing
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive learning environment

## üéØ Key Learning Objectives

1. **Document Processing**
   - Load documents from multiple formats (PDF, TXT, JSON, CSV, Word, HTML)
   - Split documents into optimal chunks for processing
   - Handle various document structures and formats

2. **Vector Operations**
   - Create document embeddings using Watsonx.ai
   - Store and manage embeddings in vector databases
   - Perform similarity searches and retrieval

3. **RAG Implementation**
   - Build complete RAG pipelines
   - Implement different retrieval strategies
   - Create question-answering systems

4. **Application Development**
   - Build web interfaces using Gradio
   - Deploy functional RAG applications
   - Integrate multiple AI services
